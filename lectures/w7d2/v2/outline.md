# Intro to immutable data 

definition: cannot be changed/ unchanging over time

developer definition: In computing, a persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure.
